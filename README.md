# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm Macw07, a passionate programmer, algorithm enthusiast, and computer science educator. I enjoy exploring the intricacies of competitive programming, developing elegant solutions to complex problems, and sharing insights on algorithm design with the community.

> When you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine.

There are two kinds of people in the world: those who dislike recursion, and those who disliked it but have come to love it again.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define ever (int i=1; i<=100; i++)
#define hope cout << "When you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine." << endl;
#define nonono cout << "Who will teach me C++?" << endl;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for ever hope
    for ever nonono;
    return 0;
}
```
